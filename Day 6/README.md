A day dedicated to learning fundamental programming concepts through interactive exercises on Reeborg's World. This project was completed as part of **Day 6** of the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" course.

## üéì Course Context

This day was part of **Day 6: Python Functions & Karel** in the 100 Days of Code curriculum. It provided essential foundation in function concepts that are critical for more complex programming tasks in subsequent days.

## üéØ Day Overview

Day 6 focused on building core programming skills through:
- Understanding function definitions and calls
- Learning about parameters and return values
- Practicing problem-solving with Karel the robot
- Developing logical thinking for programming challenges
- Mastering basic programming constructs through visual exercises

## üöÄ Learning Platform

All exercises were completed on **[Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/index_en.html)**, an educational programming environment that teaches coding concepts through robot navigation challenges.

## üõ†Ô∏è Concepts Covered

- **Function Definition**: Creating reusable blocks of code with `def`
- **Function Calls**: Executing predefined functions
- **Parameters**: Passing information to functions
- **Return Values**: Getting results back from functions
- **Code Reusability**: Writing efficient, reusable code
- **Problem Decomposition**: Breaking complex problems into smaller steps

## üìã Learning Objectives

This day helped reinforce understanding of:
- The purpose and structure of functions in programming
- How to create and call custom functions
- The difference between defining and calling a function
- How parameters allow functions to work with different data
- How return values enable functions to produce results
- Basic algorithmic thinking and problem-solving strategies

## üß© Exercise Types

While no local code files were created, the online exercises included:
- Basic movement functions (move(), turn_left())
- Custom function creation for complex maneuvers
- Loop implementations with functions
- Conditional navigation challenges
- Maze solving algorithms using functions

## üí° Key Takeaways

- Functions are essential for organizing and reusing code
- Proper function design makes programs more readable and maintainable
- Parameterized functions can handle various situations flexibly
- Return values allow functions to communicate results
- Decomposing problems into functions is a fundamental programming skill

## üîÑ Related Projects

This foundational day prepared for more complex function implementations in subsequent projects. The concepts learned here are applied throughout the rest of the 100 Days of Code journey.
