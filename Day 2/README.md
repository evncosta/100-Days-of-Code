A practical Python application that calculates how much each person should pay when splitting a bill with a tip included. This project was completed as part of **Day 2** of the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" course.

## üéì Course Context

This project was part of **Day 2: Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings** in the 100 Days of Code curriculum. It builds on fundamental programming concepts while introducing mathematical operations and more complex data handling.

## üéØ Project Overview

The Tip Calculator is a useful Python tool that:
- Takes user input for the total bill amount
- Allows selection of tip percentage (10%, 12%, or 15%)
- Accepts the number of people splitting the bill
- Calculates the exact amount each person should pay
- Demonstrates mathematical operations and data type conversions in Python

## üöÄ How It Works

1. The program welcomes the user with a greeting message
2. It prompts for the total bill amount
3. It asks for the desired tip percentage (10, 12, or 15)
4. It requests the number of people splitting the bill
5. The program calculates the final amount per person
6. The result is displayed with proper rounding to two decimal places

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3** - Core programming language
- **Mathematical Operations** - Calculations with percentages and division
- **Type Conversion** - Converting between string, float, and integer data types
- **Formatted Strings** - Displaying results with proper formatting

## üìã Learning Objectives

This project helped reinforce understanding of:
- Mathematical operations in Python
- Data type conversion (string to float/int, float to int)
- Percentage calculations
- Rounding numerical values
- Formatted string literals (f-strings)
- User input handling and validation

## üìù Example Output

```
Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? $150
What percentage tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
How many people to split the bill? 5
Each person should pay: $33.6
```
