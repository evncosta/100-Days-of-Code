A digital art generator that creates colorful dot grid patterns inspired by Damien Hirst's famous spot paintings. This project was completed as part of **Day 18** of the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" course.

## 🎓 Course Context

This project was part of **Day 18: Turtle & the Graphical User Interface (GUI)** in the 100 Days of Code curriculum. It introduces graphical programming and visual output creation.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Hirst Painting Project features:
- Generation of 10×10 grid of colorful dots
- Curated color palette with RGB values
- Precise dot placement using Turtle graphics
- Random color selection for artistic variation
- Customizable grid size and dot spacing
- Professional art-inspired output

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Sets up Turtle graphics with RGB color mode
2. Defines a curated color palette inspired by Hirst's paintings
3. Calculates grid positioning based on screen dimensions
4. Creates a 10×10 grid of randomly colored dots
5. Maintains consistent spacing between dots
6. Displays the final artwork until user interaction

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3** - Core programming language
- **Turtle Graphics** - For visual output and drawing
- **Random Module** - For random color selection
- **RGB Color Mode** - Full color spectrum support
- **Mathematical Calculations** - Precise grid positioning
- **Coordinate Geometry** - Screen dimension calculations

## 📋 Learning Objectives

This project helped reinforce understanding of:
- Turtle graphics programming and coordinate systems
- RGB color representation and manipulation
- Grid-based pattern generation
- Screen dimension calculations and positioning
- Random selection from predefined sets
- Visual programming and algorithmic art

## 🎨 Artistic Features

- **Color Palette**: 36 carefully selected RGB colors
- **Grid Size**: 10×10 dot matrix (100 total dots)
- **Dot Size**: 25-pixel diameter circles
- **Spacing**: 50 pixels between dot centers
- **Randomization**: Each dot gets a random color from the palette

## 📊 Technical Specifications

- **Screen Size**: 500×500 pixels
- **Dot Diameter**: 25 pixels
- **Grid Spacing**: 50 pixels center-to-center
- **Color Mode**: 255-value RGB system
- **Drawing Speed**: Maximum turtle speed
