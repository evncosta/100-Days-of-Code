A simple Python program that generates creative band names based on user input. This project was completed as part of **Day 1** of the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" course.

## 🎓 Course Context

This project was part of **Day 1: Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data** in the 100 Days of Code curriculum. It serves as an introduction to fundamental programming concepts that form the foundation for more complex projects later in the course.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Band Name Generator is a beginner-friendly Python application that:
- Prompts users for personal information (city they grew up in and a pet name)
- Combines these inputs to create a unique band name
- Demonstrates basic Python concepts like variables, input/output operations, and string concatenation

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The program welcomes the user with a greeting message
2. It asks for the name of the city where the user grew up
3. It asks for a suggested pet name
4. The program combines these two inputs to generate a band name
5. The result is displayed to the user

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3** - Core programming language
- **Input/Output Operations** - Basic user interaction
- **String Manipulation** - Combining text inputs

## 📋 Learning Objectives

This project helped reinforce understanding of:
- Basic Python syntax and structure
- Using the `print()` function for output
- Using the `input()` function for user input
- String concatenation and formatting
- Variable assignment and usage

## 📝 Example Output

```
Welcome to the Band Name Generator!
What is the name of the city you grew up in?
London
Suggest a name for a pet!
Whiskers
Your band name could be London Whiskers
```
