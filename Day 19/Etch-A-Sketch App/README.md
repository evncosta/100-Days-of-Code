An interactive drawing application that allows users to create digital art using keyboard controls with Python's Turtle graphics. This project was completed as part of **Day 19** of the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" course.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Turtle Drawing Program features:
- Real-time keyboard-controlled drawing
- WASD-style movement controls (familiar to gamers)
- Screen clearing functionality
- Smooth turtle movement and rotation
- Interactive graphical interface
- Simple yet powerful drawing tools

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The program initializes a turtle graphics window
2. Users control the turtle using keyboard keys:
   - **W**: Move forward 10 units
   - **S**: Move backward 10 units  
   - **A**: Rotate left 10 degrees
   - **D**: Rotate right 10 degrees
   - **C**: Clear screen and return to center
3. The turtle leaves a trail, creating drawings
4. The window remains open until clicked

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3** - Core programming language
- **Turtle Graphics** - For visual output and drawing
- **Event Listeners** - Keyboard input handling
- **Function Definitions** - Modular movement controls
- **Coordinate System** - Screen positioning and movement

## 📋 Learning Objectives

This project helped reinforce understanding of:
- Event-driven programming with keyboard listeners
- Turtle graphics coordinate system and movement
- Function binding to keyboard events
- Interactive application development
- State management (pen up/down)
- Screen clearing and reset functionality

## 🎓 Course Context

This project was part of **Day 19: Instances, State and Higher Order Functions** in the 100 Days of Code curriculum. It demonstrates practical application of event handling and state management.

## 🎮 Control Scheme

| Key | Action | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| **W** | Move Forward | Turtle moves forward 10 units |
| **S** | Move Backward | Turtle moves backward 10 units |
| **A** | Turn Left | Turtle rotates left 10 degrees |
| **D** | Turn Right | Turtle rotates right 10 degrees |
| **C** | Clear Screen | Clears drawing and returns to center |

## 📝 Example Usage

1. Run the program to open a turtle graphics window
2. Use WASD keys to control the turtle movement
3. Create drawings by moving the turtle around
4. Press C to clear the screen and start over
5. Click the window to exit the program

## 🖌️ Creative Possibilities

- Create geometric patterns and shapes
- Draw freeform artwork
- Practice coordinate geometry
- Experiment with different movement patterns
- Create algorithmic art through programmed movements

## 🔧 Customization Options

The program can be easily modified to:
- Change movement distances
- Adjust rotation angles
- Add more keyboard controls
- Change turtle appearance
- Modify screen size and colors
