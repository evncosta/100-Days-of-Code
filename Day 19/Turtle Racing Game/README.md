An exciting turtle racing game where players bet on which colored turtle will win a randomized race. This project was completed as part of **Day 19** of the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" course.

## 🎓 Course Context

This project was part of **Day 19: Instances, State and Higher Order Functions** in the 100 Days of Code curriculum. It demonstrates object management and interactive programming.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Turtle Race Game features:
- Six colorful racing turtles with different colors
- User betting interface before the race begins
- Randomized movement for unpredictable outcomes
- Finish line detection and winner determination
- Bet validation and result announcement
- Interactive graphical race display

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The game opens a betting dialog for the user to choose a turtle color
2. Six colored turtles line up at the starting position
3. Each turtle moves forward by a random distance each turn
4. The first turtle to cross the finish line wins
5. The game compares the winner with the user's bet
6. Results are displayed in the console

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3** - Core programming language
- **Turtle Graphics** - Visual racing interface
- **Random Module** - For unpredictable race outcomes
- **Event Handling** - User input through text dialogs
- **Coordinate System** - Precise turtle positioning
- **Conditional Logic** - Winner detection and bet validation

## 📋 Learning Objectives

This project helped reinforce understanding of:
- Turtle graphics programming and positioning
- Random number generation for game mechanics
- User input handling through dialog boxes
- Coordinate-based collision detection
- Game state management with boolean flags
- List operations for managing multiple objects

## 🐢 Turtle Colors Available

- **Red** 🐢
- **Orange** 🐢  
- **Yellow** 🐢
- **Green** 🐢
- **Blue** 🐢
- **Purple** 🐢

## 🏁 Race Specifications

- **Track Width**: 500 pixels
- **Track Height**: 400 pixels  
- **Start Position**: x = -230 (left side)
- **Finish Line**: x = 230 (right side)
- **Turtle Spacing**: 30 pixels vertically
- **Movement Range**: 0-10 pixels per turn

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Run the program to open the racing window
2. Enter your bet when prompted (choose a color)
3. Watch the turtles race with random movement
4. See if your chosen turtle wins in the console output
5. Click the window to exit after the race

## 🎲 Game Mechanics

- Each turtle moves 0-10 pixels per iteration randomly
- The race continues until any turtle crosses x=230
- The first turtle to cross the finish line wins
- User's bet is compared to the winning turtle's color
- Results are printed to the console
