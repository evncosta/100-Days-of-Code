An interactive text-based adventure game where players make choices to find treasure or meet their doom. This project was completed as part of **Day 3** of the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" course.

## üéì Course Context

This project was part of **Day 3: Control Flow and Logical Operators** in the 100 Days of Code curriculum. It demonstrates practical application of conditional logic to create an interactive experience with multiple possible outcomes.

## üéØ Project Overview

Treasure Island is a classic choose-your-own-adventure game that:
- Presents players with ASCII art and a compelling storyline
- Offers multiple decision points that affect the game's outcome
- Demonstrates conditional logic and user input handling
- Provides different endings based on player choices

## üöÄ How It Works

1. The game displays an elaborate ASCII art treasure map
2. Players are welcomed and given their mission objective
3. At each decision point, players choose between different options
4. The game progresses based on these choices through nested conditional statements
5. Players either find the treasure or encounter various "Game Over" scenarios

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3** - Core programming language
- **Conditional Statements** - if/elif/else logic for game branching
- **String Manipulation** - Multi-line strings and ASCII art
- **User Input Handling** - Processing and validating player choices
- **Control Flow** - Managing the game's progression path

## üìã Learning Objectives

This project helped reinforce understanding of:
- Complex conditional statements and nested if-else structures
- String formatting and multi-line strings
- User input processing and case normalization (.lower())
- Program flow control and branching logic
- Basic game design principles for text-based adventures

## üéÆ Game Decisions

The game features three critical decision points:

1. **Crossroad Choice**: Left or Right path
2. **Lake Choice**: Wait for boat or Swim across
3. **Door Choice**: Red, Yellow, or Blue door

Only one specific combination of choices leads to finding the treasure!
